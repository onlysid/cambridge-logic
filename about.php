					    <blockquote>
                         <p>We are a fast, reliable, and affordable outsourced solution for software and hardware engineering development.</p>
                        </blockquote>
						<p>Cambridge Logic was formed in 2000 by three engineers in response to requirements for various multi-disciplinary hardware and software development projects.</p>
						<p>We quickly gained a reputation for solving unusual control and signal processing problems in the process control, automation and scientific instrumentation fields. The company has since completed work in a huge range of fields giving it a unique breadth of experience for a business of this size.</p>
                        <p>Our engineers and scientists have over forty years industrial experience between them in a wide range of industries ranging from telecommunications and broadcast technology through test equipment to engine management systems. Capabilities include embedded software in a huge range of processors, FPGA design, high speed digital systems and PCB layout.</p>
					    <h3>Why choose us?</h3>
						<p>If your project is over budget, behind schedule, or needing outsourced skills, then we may be able to provide the skills and effort you require.</p>
					    <p>Our service is in demand by heavy industry, hardware manufacturers, academic institutions and software consultancies, where our team have a track record of producing innovative solutions, and of turning unusual skill areas to efficiently rescuing stalled or over-budget projects.</p>
						<p>Contract employees may help, but carry risks of spiralling costs, and lack of accountability and teamwork. Whilst we can supply individual staff on a time and materials basis, most customers prefer to agree costs before work starts. Our comprehensive team can then provide a more innovative, complete, and supported solution. </p>
						<p>We can develop alongside your staff, to ease handover, and provide quality documentation if required.</p>
						<p>And unlike with contract staff, work done on this basis is guaranteed against defects. And because we are a close team, should a specific engineer not be available, there will always be another who understands your project. </p>
